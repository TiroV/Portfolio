            <h3><u>Project:MyFlix(Angular Front end)</u></h3>
            <h4><u>Overview</u></h4>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to create a front end to use the movie API I created in a previous
                achievement
                as part of my Full-Stack Immersion Program at CareerFoundry.
                It aimed to pull everything that I had learned together and to solve the problem of the myFlix API
                needing a
                front end to fully function.
            </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/p634AoF.png" alt="movieList" class="movie_List">

            <h4><u>Specifications:</u></h4>
            <p>
                On this project, I acted as both the front and back end developer. The API was built from scratch by me,
                as well
                as hosting and maintaining all of the server-side information. The project took about one month to
                complete.
            </p>

            <h3><u>Process</u></h3>
            <h4><u>Client-Side:</u></h4>
            <p>
                The process began with organizing much of the basic setup of Angular. Installing different frameworks
                and
                organizing files in such a way to build the basic steps of the application.
            </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Umq9UJE.png" alt="repository" class="repo_List">

            <p>
                Most of it was in creating different cards and views to allow the user to sign in /
                register / access the information such as movie director and
                genre of movie associated with each film.
            </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ieGTlMQ.png" alt="genreCard" class="genre_Card">

            <p>
                Much of the setup was involved with creating a basic angular template and then writing new code to
                facilitate
                each part of the project. The project's stated goals were to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the user to sign up</li>
                <li>Allow the user to sign in</li>
                <li>Allow the user to see their own profile, with matching information to reflect their sign up data
                </li>
                <li>Allows the user to view movies from the repository, as well as allowing users to add any of the
                    movies to
                    their favorites which can be accessed on their profile</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><u>Server-Side:</u></h4>
            <p>
                After the setup of the front end to support the endpoints, I began linking the back end created in a
                previous
                project to the new functions that were required to make it run. For example,
            </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WtFGAMR.png" alt="functionGetFavoriteMovies" class="function_getMovies">


            <p>
                This is a function that returns a user's favorite movie, annotated with comments to keep things clean
                and
                readable while also informing its' purpose.
                It gets the endpoint (users/:Username/movies/:MovieID)
                from the API's code for use on the front end to display that information.
                In this case, we're dealing with favorite movies.
            </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/H9RLGXw.png" alt="movieEndPoints" class="function_endPoints">

            <h4><u>Full Stack:</u></h4>
            <p>
                The final stretch of putting this application together was mostly additions similar to the example shown
                above.
                A challenge I overcame was displaying the user's information. The endpoints had to be modified
                on the back end to properly display the user's birthday. With that feature done, the
                application was finished!
            </p>

            <h3><u>Conclusions </u></h3>
            <h4><u>Challenges faced:</u></h4>
            <p>
                When beginning the project, The API hosted on Heroku and on MongoDB
                were both hosting the information properly
                but were not working when I started testing the Angular application.
                This was a long standing challenge to find a solution for.
                I did a clean reset to both systems, re-hooked them back together
                and deployed new versions of all of them.
                It was here that I learned that file hosting platforms have
                to be constantly watched over and maintained in
                order for them to stay online and operational.
                Otherwise, one piece will fall offline and render the entire project unusable.
                There are many unseen pitfalls of web development that have to be fallen into in order to
                learn the important minutiae that more experienced developers take as given.
            </p>

            <h4><u>Reflections:</u></h4>
            <p>
                Learning angular while also trying to integrate it into an
                old project made for one of the most difficult coding
                challenges I've ever faced.
                A few parts of my older project had to be re-done in the service of making it a
                smoother experience to use when dealing with the front end.
                There's a lot that I learned when making a template / design document for this project,
                and I likely would have done a lot different had I the chance to re-do it again.
                That's the beauty of learning new things when making a project!
                You begin to understand the practical upsides of “best practices”
                and why something is done the way it is.
                Seeing them work in tandem was motivational and made me excited for what I can make in the future.
